# MalwareRL
> Malware Bypass Research using Reinforcement Learning

## Background
This is a malware manipulation environment using OpenAI's gym environments. The core idea is based on paper "Learning to Evade Static PE Machine Learning Malware Models via Reinforcement Learning" 
([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08917)). I am extending the original repo because: 
1. It is no longer maintained
2. It uses Python2 and an outdated version of LIEF
3. I wanted to integrate new Malware gym environments and additional manipulations

Over the past three years there have been breakthrough open-source projects published in the security ML space. In particular, [Ember](https://github.com/endgameinc/ember) (Endgame Malware BEnchmark for Research) and MalConv: Malware detection by eating a whole exe ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04637)) have provided security researchers the ability to develop sophisticated, reproducible models that emulate features/techniques found in NGAVs.

## MalwareRL Gym Environment
MalwareRL exposes `gym` environments for both Ember and MalConv to allow researchers to develop Reinforcement Learning agents to bypass Malware Classifiers. Actions include a variety of non-breaking (e.g. binaries will still execute) modifications to the PE header, sections, imports and overlay and are listed below.

### Action Space
```
ACTION_TABLE = {
    'modify_machine_type': 'modify_machine_type',
    'pad_overlay': 'pad_overlay',
    'append_benign_data_overlay': 'append_benign_data_overlay',
    'append_benign_binary_overlay': 'append_benign_binary_overlay',
    'add_bytes_to_section_cave': 'add_bytes_to_section_cave',
    'add_section_strings': 'add_section_strings',
    'add_section_benign_data': 'add_section_benign_data',
    'add_strings_to_overlay': 'add_strings_to_overlay',
    'add_imports': 'add_imports',
    'rename_section': 'rename_section',
    'remove_debug': 'remove_debug',
    'modify_optional_header': 'modify_optional_header',
    'modify_timestamp': 'modify_timestamp',
    'break_optional_header_checksum': 'break_optional_header_checksum'
}
```
### Agents
A baseline agent `RandomAgent` is provided to demonstrate how to interact w/ `gym` environments and expected output. This agent attempts to evade the classifier by randomly selecting an action. This process is repeated up to the length of a game (e.g. 50 mods). If the modifed binary scores below the classifier threshold we register it as an evasion. In a lot of ways the `RandomAgent` acts as a fuzzer trying a bunch of actions with no regard to minimizing the modifications of the resulting binary.

Additional agents will be developed and made available (both model and code) in the coming weeks. 

### Observation Space
The `observation_space` of the `gym` environments are an array representing the feature vector. For ember this is `numpy.array == 2381` and malconv `numpy.array == 1024**2`. The MalConv gym presents an opportunity to try RL techniques to generalize learning across large State Spaces.

## Setup
To get `malware_rl` up and running you will need the follow external dependencies:
- [LIEF](https://lief.quarkslab.com/)
- [Ember](https://github.com/Azure/2020-machine-learning-security-evasion-competition/blob/master/defender/defender/models/ember_model.txt.gz) and [Malconv](https://github.com/endgameinc/ember/blob/master/malconv/malconv.h5) models. Both of these then need to be placed into the `malware_rl/envs/utils/` directory.
- Benign binaries - a small set of "trusted" binaries (e.g. grabbed from base Windows installation) you can download some via MSFT website ([example](https://download.microsoft.com/download/a/c/1/ac1ac039-088b-4024-833e-28f61e01f102/NETFX1.1_bootstrapper.exe)). Store these binaries in `malware_rl/envs/controls/trusted`
- Run `strings` command on those binaries and save the output as `.txt` files in `malware_rl/envs/controls/good_strings`
- Download a set of malware from VirusShare or VirusTotal. I just used a list of hashes from the Ember dataset

I used a conda env set for Python3.7:
`conda create -n malware_rl python=3.7`

Finally install the Python3 dependencies in the `requirements.txt`. 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
